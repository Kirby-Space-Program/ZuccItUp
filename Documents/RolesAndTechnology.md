## Document Overview

This document contains tables outlining:

- A summary of the team's technical skills  
- Our preliminary technology choice  
- Each team members' preliminary technical roles

## Technological Skills

**Proficient** members are people who can work independently with this technology with limited support. For example, completing 1 or more courses successfully that use this technology counts as proficient.

**Willing to Learn** members are people who are familiar with the technology and are comfortable shadowing or working with a proficient member to contribute to the code base.

| Area | Technology | \# of Proficient members | \# of members Willing to Learn |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Programming languages | C++ | 4 | 0 |
|  | Bash scripting | 2 | 1 |
|  | Java | 1 | 0 |
|  | PHP | 0 | 1 |
|  | Perl | 0 | 0 |

|  | Flat file (no db) | 4 | 0 |

#### Table 1: Survey of team technological skills

## Preliminary Technology Choice

* The **First Choice** column indicates the option that we are most likely going to use for our project. At least 50% of our team is proficient with this option and the remaining team members are willing to learn.

* The **Back-up Plan** column indicates the option that we will use in the event that our first choice won’t work. At least 75% of our team is proficient with this option.

Note: these preliminary technology choices are subject to change as we figure out which languages/platforms will work best on the lab machines and what our project will require. We have selected our preliminary technology choices based on how many proficient members we have in each technology and how confident we feel that we can complete our project using that technology.

|  | First Choice | Back-up plan |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Programming language(s) | C++ | Python |
| File management | Oracle | SQLite |
| Front End | HTML/CSS/JS | Command Line |
