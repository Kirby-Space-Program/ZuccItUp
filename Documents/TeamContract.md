## 1: Team Goals

* Develop practical experience with databases.

* Create a project that we are proud of. 

* Communicate problems clearly and immediately, whether they be problems with the project direction, code, documentation, another team member, or personal matters. If an issue comes up, tell everyone\!  
    
* Become familiar and efficient in the design process of information systems

## 2: Expectations

### Attendance

* Team members are expected to attend all classes, labs, and team meetings unless the team is otherwise notified. Knowing if someone is not showing up is more helpful and respectful than waiting on them.

* Scheduled meetings and individual deadlines will likely have to be rescheduled at certain points during the project due to personal timetable conflicts and outside responsibilities. This is to be expected for a group project, since all team members have part-time jobs and several members are taking a full course load. We expect all team members to be flexible to adjust to differing personal schedules and unforeseen circumstances.

### Communication

* We expect each team member to check their messages regularly and respond in a timely and professional manner, as outlined in the team policies.

* We expect each team member to notify the others via Discord, in a timely manner, if they will not be able to make a class, lab, or meeting on time.

### Respect

* We will respect and understand that life can be busy and team members may have outside responsibilities that will take precedence over the project, we only ask for communication if it will interfere with project deadlines. 

### Workload

* We will split tasks as evenly as possible considering other class workloads and practical skills. We expect each team member to fulfill their share of the work.

* If someone is struggling with their workload at any time, we encourage them to reach out to their fellow team members or professor for help\!

### Learning 

* We will learn how to apply databases and integrate them into an information system. And we hope to be able to teach or explain how the database is used so that all members can gain at the minimum an initial understanding of database usage.  
    
* We will finish the class with the understanding of how to plan, design and implement and information systems.

## 3: Policies

### Attendance

As stated in the expectations, members should attend all classes and meetings. A grace period of lateness for up to 10 minutes is fair. More than 10 minutes of tardiness must come with a message on the discord chat informing that they will be late or unable to attend the class or meeting.

### Communication

All communication will be done through the team chat on the Discord server provided by the professor. We will set up meeting times outside the regular class hours to communicate allotted work and help each other when required.

Upon getting an @ mention in the discord chat, members are expected to respond within 24 hours.

### Workload

The workloads for each assignment should be distributed during the first class or lab in the week that the assignment starts. This will allow us to start working on the assignment early and know what our workloads are by the time we have a meeting.

Workloads will be distributed according to our personal schedules and skillsets. This may mean that our workloads won’t be the same for a single assignment, but over the course of the semester the workloads should even out. If the workloads do not even out as we get further into the project, we will bring this up in the next team meeting.

### Quality of Work

We want to produce work that we are proud of and want to be able to accurately capture our project plan in the work we present. Additionally, all code and documentation must follow the standards outlined below (under their respective headings).

### Deadlines

* Project assignments should be completed and ready for review at least 2 days before the submission deadline.

* If a team member cannot make the deadline outlined above, they should alert the other members at least 3 days before the deadline so that the team can come up with a plan to rearrange the workloads.

### Documentation Standards

Ideally, all documentation should follow these standards:

* Written in plain but professional language.

* Free of spelling and grammar errors that would prevent a user from being able to understand the meaning of a sentence.

* Easy to understand for readers who are unfamiliar with our project. Explain terms that are not common knowledge before using them.

* Easy to reference. Use links and headings to communicate the purpose of each section and what kind of information can be found within it.

* Sections should have clear and unambiguous headings.

* Project standards, descriptions, and requirements should be explained clearly and in detail. Use names and terminology wherever possible; avoid ambiguous terms.

* Markdown file format for Text and Images.  
    
* All Tables and figures are to be clearly labeled and denoted with a number and description. 

### Code Standards

Ideally, all code should follow these standards:

* All non-trivial functions and code blocks should have brief comments explaining their purpose, and more detailed comments if the mechanics of the code are very complex and need to be explained.

* Files should have a comment including the name(s) of the author(s) who contributed to the file.

* Outsourced code should include an appropriate citation. If the source is available online, a hyperlink will suffice. If not, then the name of the person who originally wrote the code should be given.

* Code blocks should be indented appropriately using 4 spaces or 1 tab.

* We will also be using the Kernighan and RItchie formatting.

### Collaboration Style

The collaboration style for our team’s documentation will be a ‘Swirly Jigsaw’ where workloads are to be allotted as the Jigsaw method suggests. During team meetings and review, we will use the Swirl method to make the final edits to our documents.

### LLM-Use Policy

Do’s:

* Grammar helper tools. This includes but is not limited to the use of tools such as Grammarly in order to correct grammar and spelling for documentation and project reports.

* Brainstorming: LLMs can be used for brainstorming ideas.

* Debugging: in the case that you have attempted to find the bug yourself to no avail, an LLM can be used to find the cause of the issue, but you are encouraged to fix it yourself. This only applies to code that you have written yourself.

* Creating test data, in the event the application requires a large amount of test data, an LLM can be used to generate the data as a time saving measure.

* Decomposing problems.

Don’ts:

* Vibe coding: do not use LLMs to generate entire functions and chunks of code. Not only does this erode the quality of the work but takes away from any learning.

* IP theft: do not give the intellectual property of others to an LLM without prior permission from the IP holder. This includes work wholly or partially written by someone other than yourself.

All uses of AI in this project must align with VIU’s Student Code of Conduct and the LLM-Use Policy in the course outline. All uses of AI must be reported to the group and a disclosure must be submitted with the assignment, using the Gen AI Use template document provided by the professor.

## 4: Consequences

### Level 1 Violation

A level 1 violation occurs if:

* A team member has missed a meeting or deadline without alerting the team.  
* A team member's work did not follow the policies outlined in this document.  
* A team member has not fulfilled their share of the work.

In this case, the team will bring up the issue in the next weekly meeting, discuss the problem, and come to a universal consensus on how to prevent this from happening again in the future. You get one neck slap.

### Level 2 Violation

A level 2 violation occurs if:

* A team member has repeatedly missed deadlines or meetings.  
* A team member has repeatedly failed to follow team policies or fulfill their share of the work.  
* The team could not come to a universal consensus for a level 1 violation.

In this case, the team will schedule an emergency meeting to have a focused discussion on how to resolve the problem and whether the professor should be notified of the issue and brought in to help resolve it. You get two neck slaps.

### Level 3 Violation

A level three violation occurs if:

* A team member repeatedly fails or refuses to communicate unfinished work.  
* The team was unable to resolve a level 2 violation.

In this case, the team is unable to resolve the problem on their own and will contact the professor to notify them of the situation. The offending team member will also receive three neck slaps, the harder the better.

## AGREEMENT

We share these goals and expectations, and agree to these policies, procedures, and consequences (repeat violations).
